<p>Cockney humour smacks, of course, of the town and makes up in smartness
and shrewdness what it lacks in mellowness. The Cockney is as a rule a
conscious humorist; you laugh <i>with</i> him very often, whereas you nearly
always laugh <i>at</i> the rustic humorist.</p>

<p>George Du Maurier concerned himself a good deal with Cockney character,
but he was not in sympathy with the Cockney; generally he had an obvious
contempt for him, and most of his jokes turn on the dropped H, the
mispronounced word, and educational deficiencies. He portrays some of
the Cockney's superficial characteristics; he despises him too much to
be able to get at the heart of him and reveal his character.</p>

<p>Take Phil May's pictures and jokes, and the difference is at once
apparent. He was fully alive to the Cockney's deficiencies of manner and
culture; now and then he quite genially and without the least touch of
scorn or self-complacency makes fun of them; but he really gives you the
Cockney character. Take, for instance, such a picture as his "Politics
and Gallantry," his "I say, 'Arry, don't we look frights!" his "Informal
Introduction"&mdash;(the self-consciousness of the girl's expression, and the
blatant pride of the man's)&mdash;here, and in almost any of his drawings you
turn to, you have the absolutely natural Cockney; his types are full of
character and so true and free from condescension that not only are we
moved irresistibly to laugh at them, but the Cockney himself would be
the first to recognise their truth and to laugh joyously at them too. We
may say pretty much the same of Charles Keene, of Mr. Raven-Hill, of Mr.
Bernard Partridge, and of others of the "Punch" artists represented
here, who illustrate the essential Cockney character, and do not go on
the easy assumption that dropped H's and mispronounced words and
aggressive vulgarity are the beginning and the end of it.</p>

<h2>NOTE BY A COCKNEY NATURALIST</h2>

<p>The common blackbeetles (<i>Scarabæus niger</i>) which so abundantly infest
the culinary regions of Cockaigne are alleged to be agreeable, although
profuse, in flavour, provided they be delicately larded before crimping,
and then fricasseed or simply fried. Care should specially be taken not
to injure their antennæ, which, when crisp with egg and breadcrumbs,
exquisitely tickle the palate of the gourmet, and provoke him to the
liveliest of gastronomic feats. There lurks in vulgar minds a savage
prejudice against these interesting insects, by reason, very likely, of
the popular impression that at times they have been manufactured into
Soy. But this may be assumed to be mere idle superstition, and Soyer,
the great <i>chef</i>, wisely set his face against it, remarking, as he did
so, "<i>Honi Soy qui mal y pense.</i>"</p>

<p>Among the warblers which abound in the vicinity of the metropolis, one
of the most interesting is the little mudlark (<i>Alauda Greenwichiensis</i>)
whose plaintive cry may nightly be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span> heard upon the shore of the river,
where these little creatures congregate in flocks, and pick up any grub
which they may chance to meet with.</p>

<p>Doubts have been entertained by sundry Cockney naturalists whether the
pyramids of oyster shells, which in the early part of August used to be
noticed in the streets, should be regarded as a proof of the migratory
habits of the mollusc. That the oyster is a sluggard and objects to
leave his bed seems pretty generally admitted; but that he is endowed
with the power of locomotion has, fortunately for science, been placed
beyond a doubt. Whether oysters shed their shells when they are crossed
in love is a point on which the naturalist is still somewhat in the
dark.</p>

<h2>OBSERVATIONS BY A COCKNEY NATURALIST</h2>

<p>A nightingale has been heard singing in Kensington Gardens (<i>vide
Times</i>, April 19). A salmon has been seen swimming close to London
Bridge. A trout has been observed (reposing on a marble slab) near to
Charing Cross. Sticklebacks have been captured in the waters of the
Serpentine. Plovers eggs have been discovered in the middle of Covent
Garden: I myself have found there as many as two dozen in a single walk.
There is a rookery in St. Giles's, well known to the police. I have seen
a pigeon shot not far from Shepherd's Bush, and I have heard one has
been plucked by a member of the hawk tribe at another West-End haunt.
Blackbeetles are common in the back kitchens of Belgravia, and
bluebottles abound among the butchers of Whitechapel during the warm
months. There is another kind of fly, which is said to be indigenous to
the stables of the jobmasters, and which also may be seen by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span> observant
Cockney naturalists, but less seldom in Whitechapel than near the
Regent's Park. Sparrow-clubs have not been established yet in London,
but pea-shooters are common in many of its streets. I am told that early
risers may hear a male canary singing in the neighbourhood of Islington
at four o'clock, <span class="smcap">A.M.</span>, and may also hear a cock crow any morning, except
Sunday, between five and six o'clock. The thrush has been observed among
sundry of the children, under medical inspection, in the nurseries and
infant hospitals of town. Little ducks are plentiful in the <i>salons</i> of
Tyburnia, and in Bayswater and Brompton there are numbers of great
geese. Welsh rabbits may be seen close to Covent Garden, and wild
turkeys have been noticed even in the Strand, hanging by the beak. In
the purlieus of St. Stephen's, where are the sacred haunts of the
collective wisdom of the kingdom, I have heard the hootings of many an
old owl. From information which I have received from members of the
metropolitan police, I may assert that larks are common in the
Haymarket, and that on the shores of the silver Thames at Wapping there
is frequently observable a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span> goodly flock of mudlarks. From similar
information, I may add that there are careful observers in the streets
who rarely pass a day without their setting their eyes upon a robbin'.
Who shall say that in the very midst of the metropolis there is not
abundant evidence of a truly rural, and a tooral-looral life?</p>

<h2>MISTAKES ABOUT SCOTLAND</h2>

<center><i>(Contributed by a Converted Cockney)</i></center>

<p>It is a mistake to believe that every Scotchman, when he goes to
Edinburgh, immediately walks down Princes Street clad in the ancient
costume of the Highlanders.</p>

<p>It is a mistake to believe that the <i>pièce de résistance</i> at every
Scotch dinner-party is a haggis.</p>

<p>It is a mistake to believe that a Scotchman does not enjoy a joke every
bit as much as an Englishman.</p>

<p>It is a mistake to believe that a Scotch Sabbath in the country is a
whit more <i>triste</i> than an English Sunday in the provinces.</p>

<p>It is a mistake to believe that a Scotchman sets a greater value upon
his "bawbee" than an Englishman upon his shilling or an American upon
his dollar.</p>

<p>It is a mistake to believe that inns in Scotland are dearer and less
comfortable than hotels in England.</p>

<p>It is a mistake to believe that we have a city in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span> England that can
compare favourably (from an architectural point of view) with the town
of Edinburgh.</p>

<p>It is a mistake to believe that it always rains in the Isle of Skye.</p>

<p>It is a mistake to believe that there are no more "Fair Maids" in the
houses of Perth.</p>

<p>It is a mistake to believe that Hampstead Heath is as beautiful as
Dunkeld.</p>

<p>It is a mistake to believe that the Caledonian Canal is at all like the
Serpentine.</p>

<p>It is a mistake to believe that Aberdeen is less imposing in appearance
than Chelsea or Islington.</p>

<p>It is a mistake to believe that the countrymen of Scott and Burns do not
appreciate the works of Shakspeare, Milton, Byron, Dickens, Thackeray,
and Tennyson.</p>

<p>And, lastly (this is added to the Cockney's list by the wisest sage of
this or any other age), it is the greatest mistake of all to believe
that <i>Mr. Punch</i> does not like and respect (in spite of an occasional
joke at their expense) the kindly, homely, sound-hearted people who live
north of the Tweed.</p>

<h2>NOTES BY A COCKNEY NATURALIST</h2>

<p>There are various kinds of larks to be observed by Cockney naturalists,
which are more or less, and rather less than more, indigenous to London.
There is first of all the cage lark (<i>Alauda Miserrima</i>) which is
chiefly found on grass-plats measuring about two inches square, and may
be heard singing plaintively in many a back slum. Then there is the mud
lark (<i>Alauda Greenwichiensis</i>), which is principally seen towards
nightfall on the shores of the river, when the whitebait is in season.
This little lark is a migratory bird, and flits from place to place in
quest of anything worth picking up that may happen to be thrown to it.
Finally, there is the street lark (<i>Alauda Nocturna</i>), which is known to
most policemen in the neighbourhood of the Haymarket, and the like
nocturnal haunts.</p>

<p>As a gratifying proof of our progressing civilisation, there has been of
recent years a very marked decrease in the number of white mice, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
monkeys dressed as soldiers, exhibited by organ-grinders in the London
streets. Trained dogs appear, however, decidedly more numerous, and
performing canaries may be met with not infrequently in the squares of
the West End. The naturalist should note, moreover, that the learned
British pig (<i>Porcus Sapiens Britannicus</i>) which, within the memory of
men who are still living, used commonly to infest the fairs near the
metropolis, has recently well nigh completely disappeared and is
believed by sundry naturalists to be utterly extinct.</p>

<p>The rum shrub (<i>Shrubbus Curiosus</i>) which, although deserving of close
investigation has somehow escaped mention in the pages of Linnæus, is
found in great profusion in the purlieus of Whitechapel, as well as
other parts of London where dram-drinkers do congregate. It may be
generally discovered in proximity to the Pot-tree (<i>Arbor
Pewteriferens</i>), which may be readily recognised by its metallic fruit.</p>

<p>The common cat of the metropolis (<i>Felis Catterwaulans</i>) is remarkable,
especially for the exceeding frequency and shrillness of its cries when
it goes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span> upon the tiles, or proceeds to other spots of feline popular
resort. Sleep becomes impossible within earshot of its yellings, and the
injury they cause to property as well as human temper is immense. It
has, indeed, been roughly estimated that thirty thousand water-jugs are
annually sacrificed, within a circuit of not more than six miles from
St. Paul's, by being hurled from bedroom windows with the aim to stop
these squalling feline "Voices of the night."</p>

<p>A certain proof that oysters are amphibious may be noted in the fact
that they always build their grottoes in the courts and the back streets
of the metropolis where, in the month of August, with extravagant
profusion, their shells are yearly cast.</p>

<p>The scarlet-coated lobster (<i>Le Homard Militaire</i>, Cuvier) has been
frequently discovered on the shores of the Serpentine, or basking by the
margin of the water in St. James's Park. This crustacean, when treated
well, will drink like a fish, excepting that, unlike a fish, he does not
confine himself to water for his drink. His shell (jacket) is of a
bright red colour, which is not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span> produced, as in the lobster species
generally, by the agency of the caloric in the act of being boiled. The
scarlet-coated lobster leads, while in London, a very peaceful life,
notwithstanding his presumed propensities for fighting.</p>

<p>If we may credit the statistics which, with no slight labour, have been
recently collected, no fewer than five million and eleven blue-bottles
are annually slaughtered in the butchers' shops of London, before
depositing their ova in the primest joints of meat. The number of the
smaller flies which, merely in the City, are every year destroyed for
buzzing round the bald heads of irritable bank clerks, amounts, it has
been calculated, to one million three hundred thousand and thirteen.</p>

<h2>SONGS FOR THE NATION</h2>

<center>"Λαυς αρε α λυξυρυ σογγς εσσεντιαλΛαυς αρε α λυξυρυ σογγς εσσεντιαλ"</center>

<p class="author"><i>'Arrystophanes.</i></p>

<p>It is evident that the nation is yearning for singable songs in the
'Arry dialect. The late lamented Artemus Ward would probably have said,
"Let her yearn"; but a stern sense of duty impels me to try and meet the
need, created by the <i>Daily Chronicle</i>. I have a comforting impression
that all that is necessary to insure correctness is to "chinge" as many
"a"s as possible into "i"s. By this means I secure the "local
colouring," which, by the way, has undergone a complete change since
Dickens spelt Weller "with a wee, my lord." A catchword, à propos of
nothing, is always useful, so I have duly provided it.</p>

<div class="poem w36"><div class="stanza">
<p><span class="smcap">Dear Charlie,</span></p>
<p class="i6">A 'Appy New Year to yer! That's the straight tip for to-day,</p>
<p class="i0">So I'm bound to be in it, old chip, though things don't <i>look</i> remarkable gay.</p>
<p class="i0">I inclose you a card&mdash;a correct one, I 'ope, though it strikes one as queer</p>
<p class="i0">That such picters is thought <i>apprypo</i> this perticular time of the year.</p>
</div><div class="stanza">
<p class="i0">You'll observe there's a hangel in muslin a twisting 'erself all awry,</p>
<p class="i0">With some plums, happle-blossoms, and marigolds, backed by a dab o' blue sky.</p>
<p class="i0">Dekkyrative it's called, so the mivvy informed me who nobbled my tanner;</p>
<p class="i0"><i>I</i> call it a little bit mixed, like the art on a Odd-Fellow's banner.</p>
</div><div class="stanza">
<p class="i0">But, bless you, it's all of a piece, Charlie&mdash;life is so muddled with rot</p>
<p class="i0">That it takes rayther more than a judge or a jury to tell yer wot's wot.</p>
<p class="i0">Whether knifing a boy 'cos one's peckish means murder if lyings are libels,</p>
<p class="i0">Seem questions as bothers the big wigs, in spite of their blue books and Bibles.</p>
</div><div class="stanza">
<p class="i0">Where are we, old pal? that's the question. Perhaps it would add to one's ease</p>
<p class="i0">If life wos declared a "mixed wobble," it's motter a "go as you please."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span></p>
<p class="i0">But 'tisn't all cinder-path, Charlie, wus luck! if it was, with "all in,"</p>
<p class="i0">You wouldn't go fur wrong, I fancy, in backing "yours truly" to win.</p>
</div><div class="stanza">
<p class="i0">"A 'Appy New Year!" That's the cackle all over the shop like to-day.</p>
<p class="i0">Wot's 'Appiness? Praps Mister Ruskin and little Lord Garmoyle will say.</p>
<p class="i0">You an' me's got <i>our</i> notions of yum-yum, as isn't fur wide o' the mark,</p>
<p class="i0">But who'll give us change for 'em, Charlie? Ah! that's where we're left in the dark.</p>
</div><div class="stanza">
<p class="i0">The Reform Bill won't do it, my pippin, on that you may lay your last dollar.</p>
<p class="i0">The fact is this 'Appy New Year fake is 'oller, mate, hutterly 'oller.</p>
<p class="i0">'Twon't fly&mdash;like the Christmas card hangels, it doesn't fit into the facks;</p>
<p class="i0">All it does is to spread tommy-rot, and to break all the postmen's poor backs.</p>
</div><div class="stanza">
<p class="i0">You'll be thinking I've got the blue-mouldies, old man, and you won't be fur hout.</p>
<p class="i0">Funds low with yours truly, my bloater, no chances of getting about.</p>
<p class="i0">Larks, any amount of 'em, going, advertisements gassing like fun,</p>

<p class="i0">It's cutting, that's wot it is, <i>cutting</i>. I'm so used to leading the field,</p>
<p class="i0">That place as fust-fly at life's fences is one as I <i>don't</i> like to yield,</p>
<p class="i0">Espechly to one like Bill Blossit&mdash;no style, not a bit about Bill!</p>
<p class="i0">And they talk of a 'Appy New Year, mate, and cackle o' peace and goodwill!</p>

<p class="i0">Oh yus, I'd goodwill 'em, Bill Blossit and false Fanny Friswell, a lot!</p>
<p class="i0">They are off to the world's fair to-night, sir, and <i>that's</i> wy I say it's such rot.</p>
<p class="i0">If form such as mine's to go 'obbling whilst mugginses win out o' sight,</p>
<p class="i0">I say the world's handicap's wrong, mate, and Christmas cards won't set it right.</p>
</div><div class="stanza">
<p class="i0">Lor bless yer, 'e ain't got no patter, not more than a nutmeg, Bill ain't;</p>
<p class="i0">But the railway has taken his shop, and he's come out as fresh as new paint.</p>
<p class="i0">And so because <i>I'm</i> out of luck, and that duffer has landed the chink,</p>
<p class="i0">She 'ooks onto him <i>like</i> a bat to a belfry, sir! What do <i>you</i> think?</p>
</div><div class="stanza">
<p class="i0">A 'Appy New Year? Yus, it looks like it! Charlie, old chap, I've heard tell</p>
<p class="i0">Of parties called pessymists, writers as swear the whole world's a big sell;</p>
<p class="i0">No doubt they've bin jilted, or jockeyed by some such a juggins as Bill;</p>
<p class="i0">And without real jam&mdash;cash and kisses&mdash;this world is a bitterish pill.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span></p>

<p class="i0">Still, I wish you a 'Appy New Year, if you care for the kibosh, old chappie,</p>
<p class="i0">Though 'taint 'igh art cards full o' gush and green paint'll make you and me 'appy.</p>
<p class="i0">Wot <i>we</i> want is lucre and larks, love and lotion as much as you'll carry!</p>
<p class="i0">Give me them, and one slap at that Bill,&mdash;They're the new year gifts to suit.</p>

<h2>A SONG OF SPRING</h2>

<center><i>By a Cockney Poet.</i></center>

<div class="poem w32"><div class="stanza">
<p class="i0">All hail, thou jocund time of year,</p>
<p class="i0">To Cockneys and cock-robins dear!</p>
<p class="i0">All hail, thou flowery, showery season,</p>
<p class="i0">When throstles, mating, perch the trees on:</p>
<p class="i0">When sparrows on the house-tops sit,</p>
<p class="i0">And court their loves with cheery twit:</p>
<p class="i0">While opera songsters tune their throats,</p>
<p class="i0">Exchanging for our gold their notes!</p>
<p class="i0">Now Nature her new dress receives,</p>
<p class="i0">And dinner-tables spread their leaves;</p>
<p class="i0">Asparagus again one sees,</p>
<p class="i0">And early ducklings, served with peas;</p>
<p class="i0">Again the crisp whitebait we crunch,</p>
<p class="i0">And chops of lambkin blithely munch;</p>
<p class="i0">Salmon again our shops afford,</p>
<p class="i0">And plovers' eggs adorn the board;</p>
<p class="i0">While for one day at least our sons</p>
<p class="i0">May stuff themselves with hot cross buns!</p>
<p class="i2">See now the swells begin to show</p>
<p class="i0">Their horsemanship in Rotten Row:</p>
<p class="i0">See now the Drive is thronged once more,</p>
<p class="i0">And idlers lounge there as of yore:</p>
<p class="i0">See now fair April fills Mayfair,</p>
<p class="i0">And gives new life to Grosvenor Square.</p>
<p class="i0">See now what crowds flock to the Zoo,</p>
<p class="i0">Where Master Hippo is on view</p>
<p class="i0">See daffodils, and daisies pied</p>
<p class="i0">In bloom, and buttercups beside:</p>
<p class="i0">See now the thorn, and e'en the rose</p>
<p class="i0">Signs of returning Spring disclose:</p>
<p class="i0">See now the lilac large in bud;</p>
<p class="i0">While costermongers, splashed with mud,</p>
<p class="i0">The product of the passing showers,</p>
<p class="i0">Cry, "Here's yer all a blowing flowers!"</p>
<p class="i0">Or wake the echoes of the groves<a name="FNanchor_A_A" id="FNanchor_A_A"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_A" class="fnanchor"><sup>[A]</sup></a></p>

permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to

Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you

rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.net/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.net

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or

form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works

access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
